# iSenhas website (Public)

iSenhas is a privacy-focused password manager designed with security, transparency, and user control as core principles.

This repository contains the **public client implementation** of the iSenhas website.

---

## 🔐 Security

Security and transparency are core principles of iSenhas.

This repository contains the public client-side code of the website, allowing independent review and community auditing.

### Security Documentation

- 📄 [Security Policy](SECURITY.md)
- 🛡️ [Threat Model](THREAT_MODEL.md)

### Security Features

- Client-side encryption
- AES-256 encryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation
- Optional Zero-Knowledge architecture
- No transmission of master passwords
- Minimal browser permissions
- Defense-in-depth design

We welcome responsible security research and community feedback.

## 🔐 Security First

iSenhas is built around a security-centric architecture:

- Client-side encryption
- Optional Zero-Knowledge mode
- Local cryptographic operations
- No plaintext secrets transmitted to the server in Zero-Knowledge mode

All sensitive encryption processes happen locally on the user’s device.

## 🌐 Repository Scope

This public repository exists to provide **transparency and auditability**.

Included in this repository:

- User interface
- Local storage logic
- Cryptographic workflow (client-side)
- Security model implementation

Not included:

- Proprietary automation modules
- Internal heuristics and optimization systems
- Backend infrastructure and operational services

Some components of iSenhas are maintained in private repositories.

## 🧠 Security Model

iSenhas supports different operational modes:

### Extreme privacy Mode (Recommended)
- Zero-Knowledge encryption
- Encryption occurs locally
- Master password never leaves the device
- Server stores only encrypted data
- Server cannot access user secrets

### Cloud Convenience Mode
- Enables additional usability features
- May involve server-side processing depending on configuration
- Designed for users prioritizing convenience over extreme privacy

Users can choose the model that best fits their needs.

## 🔍 Transparency Commitment

The goal of this repository is to allow:

- Independent security review
- Community auditing
- Architectural transparency
- Trust verification

Security is based on verifiable design, not obscurity.
